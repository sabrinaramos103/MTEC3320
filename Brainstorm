One hypothetical object from the 'Escape the Bank' game concept is an 'alarm system'. 
The alarm system would be represented by speakers and police lights (if possible).
It would look very similar to a police light, if not could be utilized as a screen flashing 'blue' and 'red'
This would alert the players when the 'police' are going to arrive to their location.
The location aspect could be projected using the projector within our classroom, could be shown through a single computer screen.
The sounds would be alarming and loud enough for players to potentially get startled (still up for debate)
This would create tension for the players, as time lessens causing them to scramble to collect money and such.
